## Mobile

For the mobile portion of the test, use the `/mobile` folder. There are 7 features we'd like to add:

1. Fetch and display the list of currencies available on MoonPay (see endpoint below).
2. Add styles to create a responsive layout that will display one column on mobile devices and two columns on tablet devices.
3. Add a toggle to control if currencies not supported in the US should be displayed.
4. Add a toggle to control if currencies not available in test mode should be displayed.
5. Add a button to sort the list of currencies by alphabetical order using the name of the currencies.
6. Add a button to sort the list of currencies by alphabetical order using the symbol/code of the currencies.
7. Add a button to apply a random shuffle to the list of currencies when it is clicked.

Feel free to structure the code however you prefer and use third-party libraries at your discretion.

Do not spend too much time on making it beautiful. Basic aesthetics are welcome, but we are not
grading your design skills here.

### NOTE

React Native must be used as the base library and the application should work in both android and iOS devices
